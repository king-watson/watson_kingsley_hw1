# SWAPI AJAX REDUX

## Overview 🚀 
This repository contains a Star Wars Character & Movie Guide, developed as part of my Web Development coursework. The goal of this project is to research and consume a public API (SWAPI), dynamically fetch data using JavaScript, and present it in a responsive, interactive interface.

The application allows users to browse a list of Star Wars characters and click on a character to view detailed movie information — including the movie title, opening crawl, and poster — all loaded dynamically using AJAX requests.

## Assignment Goals & Learning Objectives 🎯
This project was designed to demonstrate:

- Understanding and usage of REST APIs
- Working with JSON data
- Multiple asynchronous fetch requests
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Responsive layout and interactive UI design
- GitHub best practices using branches

### Requirements Addressed ✅
API Data Consumption (SWAPI)

Characters are fetched from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.info)
A minimum of 10 characters are dynamically populated into an unordered list
Dynamic Character List

Each list item displays:

- Character name
- A clickable link tied to a movie the character appears in
- No hard-coded character data
- Second AJAX Call (Movie Data)
- When a character is clicked:
- A second fetch request is triggered

The following movie details are displayed in a separate section:
- Movie title
- Opening crawl
- Movie poster (stored locally in the /images folder)
- Graceful Fetch Handling

All AJAX requests handle different states:
- Loading state with a loading icon
- Successful data retrieval
- Error handling for failed requests

## Technology Used 🛠️
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API (AJAX)
- SWAPI (Star Wars API)
- HTML <template> element / template literals
- Git & GitHub

## Responsiveness 📱
The website is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop  
- Tablet  
- Mobile  

Built using a 12-grid + 4-grid layout system.

## GreenSock Enhancements ✨
GreenSock (GSAP) animations for:

- List item transitions
- Movie content reveals
- UI feedback and polish
- These enhancements improve the overall user experience and visual engagement. 

## GitHub Workflow & Best Practices 🌱
This project follows proper GitHub workflow guidelines:

- Main branch contains only completed, production-ready code

Development completed in feature branches such as:

- dev.xx.script
- des.xx.ui
- All features merged into main before submission
